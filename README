This tool is to visualize alias usage to parse command history. You can evaluate whether you use alias efficiently or not.
* It can show reduced types and more redusable types
* It can show how degree you use each alias

The visabliable shell scripts is the followings:
* zsh (${HOME}/.zsh-history)


Install:

gem install alias_metrics


How to use:

$ alias | alias_metrics


Case Study:

$ alias | alias_metrics
>>

You reduce 10.25% types (29814 / 290970)

If you use alias all, you can reduce more 3.98% types (11575 / 290970)



 You often forget the following alias

 alias   #used   #forgot forgot rate(%)  command

 g       9       1530    99.42   git

 _       0       210     100.00  sudo

 gco     24      197     89.14   git checkout

 ga      516     190     26.91   git add

 ...
<<
I regist alias g=`git`, but I often forgot to use this alias. This result show I typed "git" 1530 times. So I can reduce 1530 * 2 = 3060 types by typing "g" instead of "git".


Todo:

* It can parse other shell scrpt(bash, csh, etc...)
* Add the function that recommends alias that can reduce your types by setting it
* Add the function that show Gold Standard
* Acceleration
